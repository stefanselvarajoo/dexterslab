Group 4 Future Lab

Building a website for guided set-up/teardown of devices

As the title suggests, "Future Lab" is an attempt at advancing our current set of rules to meet more production
demand from customers. The idea is simple, automate more, thereby freeing up the engineer from the mundane.

However, to deal with the future, one must deal with the past. The past is the following:
1. Air conditioning system breakdown recently
2. Room in a mess
3. Difficult to track devices
4. Manual booking using hard copies

Tasks Completed:

1. Create Log In/Register
2. Create basic booking feature
3. Finding Available slots

Yet to implement:
1. Session variable security
2. Pass available slots back to drawRack
3. Confirmation dialog in deploy.html
